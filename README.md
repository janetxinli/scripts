# Bioinformatics Scripts

This is a collection of scripts for analyzing different forms of bioinformatics data.

To run the Python scripts, make sure to set the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` to the root of this directory:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/scripts
```

This is necessary for importing modules between scripts.
